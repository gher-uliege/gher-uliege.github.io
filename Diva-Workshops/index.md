Since 2006, we organize workshops for the DIVA users, principally members of the regional groups responsible for the climatology production in [SeaDataNet](https://www.seadatanet.org/) and SeaDataCloud projects. Participants from EMODnet Chemistry also attended the workshop.

The training is provided by several experts from the GHER, who adapt the content to the level of users (from beginnings to advanced users). A wish-list from users is established at the end of the workshop and most of the changes
are implemented during the following weeks or months.
