## Preparation

### Computers

Participants will have with them a laptop with:
* 16 GB RAM memory and
* sufficient free disk space (approx. 50 GB).
* Data files necessary for the preparation of a climatology.

More computing resources might be necessary depending on the resolution and size of the studied domain.

You may also need to check the list of [acronyms and definitions](../acronyms.md).

### Workshop material

The notebooks are available in the folder `notebooks` in the [zip file](https://github.com/gher-ulg/Diva-Workshops/archive/master.zip).
Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/gher-ulg/Diva-Workshops/tree/master/notebooks#how-to-download-ipynb-files-from-github) to download and open the notebook files.

### Installation

Please install the following software beforehand:

* [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) language
* [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl), the `Julia` kernel for Jupyter.
* [PyPlot](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyPlot.jl), the interface to use matplotlib.pyplot.
* [OceanDataView](https://odv.awi.de/), to pre-process the data files.
* Follow the steps described here: [installation](../installation.md).

Please make sure to install all these software early enough before the workshop. If you have an issue, you can contact us by mail about 1 week before the workshop and we will try to help you via mail.

### Before the workshop...

‚úÖ If you plan to use your own dataset, please verify that it has been quality-controlled.

‚úÖ If your institution is part of [eduroam](https://www.eduroam.org/), be sure to have your credentials for the wifi connexion.

‚úÖ Register at [Marine ID](https://www.marine-id.org/) and bring your username and password
(in order to access the *Virtual Research Environment*).
